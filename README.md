### Running Scripts in Beekeeper Studio

Beekeeper Studio is a popular and user-friendly SQL client. Here's how to run SQL scripts using it:

1.  **Open Beekeeper Studio:** Launch the Beekeeper Studio application.
2.  **Connect to your database:** If you haven't already, create a new connection to your database server. You'll need to provide details like the database type, host, port, username, and password.
3.  **Open the SQL script:**
    * You can open an existing `.sql` file by going to **File > Open** and selecting your script file.
    * Alternatively, you can copy and paste the SQL code directly into a new query editor window (**File > New Query** or the "+" button).
4.  **Execute the script:**
    * To run the entire script, click the **"Run"** button (usually a play icon) or use the keyboard shortcut (e.g., `Ctrl+Enter` or `Cmd+Enter`).
    * To run a specific selection of the script, highlight the desired SQL code and then click the **"Run Selected"** button or use the corresponding keyboard shortcut.
5.  **Review the results:** After execution, Beekeeper Studio will display the results of your queries, including any output, error messages, or affected rows.
